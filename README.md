# GILDED ROSE

This is the Gilded Rose kata in JavaScript with Jest. I approached this challenge with the SOLID principles and polymorphism in mind. I started by creating a separate updateItem class which met all of the criteria, which I subsequently broke down into smaller classes for each individual items. This made it much easier to keep track of what was going on and ensure all requirements were met. The whole suite has been run with ESLINT and has 100% test coverage with Jest. I made use of diagramming which helped me to get a grasp of how the program I was building was actually working. 

## GETTING STARTED
